If you find them helpfull or want to add a script for another Excersise from the Smartlearn modul then feel free to open a pull request


### Usage

  - At the current Moment, the Script does not work.
  - Clone the Repo on to the Client, in my case vm Client VM in Smartlearn
  - make the Bash file executlable
  - Execute the Script and provide the Arguments
